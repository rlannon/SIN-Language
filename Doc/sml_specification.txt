SML_SPECIFICATION.TXT

An overview of the SML file format.

SIN VM Executable files (.sml, for "SIN Machine Language") are produced by the Linker from SIN object fiels (.sinc). SML files are very simple and contain a small header to properly initialize the VM, followed by a series of bytes for the program data.

FILE HEADER:
	0x00 - 0x03	-	_magic_number	-	's' 'm' 'l' '$'
	0x04		-	_wordsize	-	1 = 8; 2 = 16; 3 = 32; 4 = 64
	0x05		-	_ver		-	SIN VM version
	0x06 - 0x09	-	_prg_size	-	number of bytes to read as program data
	0x0A - 0x0F	-	currently unused but reserved for future file versions
	0x10 +		-	PRG_DATA
