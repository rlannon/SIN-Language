MEMORY_MAP.TXT

An overview of how memory addresses in the SIN VM are organized.

$0000	-	$0FFF:		_DATA
	Used for variables, etc. 2K
	Ascending

$1000	-	$1FFF:		_STACK	
	Our stack; used for function arguments, local variables, etc.
	Descending

$2000	-	$2FFF		_CALL_STACK
	Used for subroutine calls. This way, our regular stack won't be affected by subroutine calls, and will allow us to more easily push function arguments to the stack before calling.

$3000	-	$EFFF:		_PRG
	Used for the program data itself

$F000	-	$FFFF:		_ENV and _ARG
	Used for command-line arguments and such to the program
