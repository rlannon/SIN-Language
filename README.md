# SIN-Language

This is the preliminary parser and interpreter (and eventually, compiler) for the SIN programming language. SIN is a procedural programming language based on C and Python.

## Goal of the Project

This project is a hands-on way of learning how parsers, compilers, and interpreters operate. The purpose of this project is not to create an efficient, lightweight, and useful programming language or compiler; this is a first attempt, and as such it will be mediocre at best. The goal is to serve as a learning exercise in compiler writing and solving various programming problems in the C++ language.

## Getting Started

### Installation / Build

There are currently no working binaries for the program; you must build it yourself using the main file.

### Using SIN

Consult the wiki for an introduction and reference to the language. It is small and simple, but will continually grow in complexity as I wrote more code to allow for compilation / interpretation.
_The program currently only supports ASCII-encoded files_, it will not be able to parse Unicode or other encoding standards. This is something I intend to change once the parser and compiler are more or less functional.
