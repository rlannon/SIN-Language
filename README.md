# SIN-Language

This is the preliminary parser and compiler for the SIN programming language. SIN is a procedural programming language based on C and Python.

## Goal of the Project

This project is a hands-on way of learning how parsers and compilers operate. The purpose of this project is not to create an efficient, lightweight, and useful programming language or compiler; this is a first attempt, and as such it will be mediocre at best. The goal is to serve as a learning exercise in compiler writing and solving various programming problems in the C++ language.

## Getting Started

## Installation / Build

There are currently no working binaries for the program; you must build it yourself using the main file. As the parser is not even fully built (only the lexer is functional at this point), the build process should be fairly painless.

### Using SIN

Consult the wiki for an introduction and reference to the language. It is small and simple, but will continually grow in complexity as I wrote more of the compiler.
_The program currently only supports ASCII-encoded files_, it will not be able to parse Unicode or other encoding standards. This is soemthing I intend to change once the parser and compiler are more or less functional.
